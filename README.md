The Odin Project Recipe Project
Overview

This is my first project from The Odin Project Foundations Course. The goal of this project is to practice basic HTML skills by building a simple website that displays a collection of recipes.

What I Will Build

The website will include:

A main index page that links to several individual recipe pages.

Each recipe page will contain:

A title and image of the dish

A brief description

An ingredient list

Step-by-step cooking instructions

Skills Practiced

Structuring a webpage using HTML5 elements

Using lists, links, images, and paragraphs

Organizing files and folders in a project directory

Writing clean and readable code following best practices

Goals

By the end of this project, I will:

Gain confidence in creating and linking multiple web pages

Understand how to structure simple content with HTML

Prepare for adding CSS styling in future lessons
